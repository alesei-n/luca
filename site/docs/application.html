          <h1>Luca.Application</h1>
<p>A large single-page app generally needs some sort of globally available state tracking object, as well as something which acts as a single entry point into the application, and some sort of gateway to important objects.   

</p>
<p>Luca.Application is a type of Viewport class which handles things such as:

</p>
<ul>
<li>collection manager ( manages your collections for you ) </li>
<li>socket manager ( relays websocket events as Backbone.Events )</li>
<li>url fragment router (<code>Backbone.Router</code>)</li>
<li>global attributes and change event bindings</li>
<li>page controller ( displays a unique page of the application) </li>
<li>active view, active sub view helpers</li>
</ul>
<p>The Luca.Application stores its state in a <code>Backbone.Model</code>, which means you can <code>get()</code> and <code>set()</code> attributes directly on the application, as well as bind to change events on the application itself, and expect the same API you would from a normal model.

</p>
<p>The ability to treat the Luca.Application instance as both a view, and a model allows for some clean patterns.  Your views can declaratively list its dependency on the global application state attributes.

<pre><code class="lang-coffeescript">  _.def("MyView").extends("Luca.View").with
    name: "my_view"

    applicationEvents:
      "change:status" : "onStatusChange"

    onStatusChange: (app, currentStatus)-&gt;
      if currentStatus is "inactive"
        @markInactive()

    markInactive: ()-&gt;
      # mark this view inactive if the application
      # goes into inactive status


  app = Luca.getApplication()

  # this will cause the view named 'my_view' to 
  # to fire its markInactive() method
  app.set("status", "inactive")</code></pre>
