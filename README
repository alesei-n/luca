Luca is a framework for creating UI Components such as forms, and grids, similar to the ExtJS framework but with backbone as the underlying library.

Luca has containers, which can have a configurable layout.  Each container has an array of items which are organized according to the layout.

Inspired by backbone-forms, and extjs
